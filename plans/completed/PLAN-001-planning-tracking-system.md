# PLAN-001: Planning & Tracking System Implementation

## Plan Overview

- **ID**: PLAN-001
- **Title**: Planning & Tracking System Implementation
- **Status**: Completed
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-07-09
- **Started**: 2025-07-09
- **Estimated Completion**: 2025-07-09
- **Owner**: System
- **Type**: Infrastructure

## Description

Implement a streamlined autonomous planning and tracking system for the SuShe Online project. The system treats plans as self-contained units and uses separate quick tasks for simple changes. This creates a clean separation between complex work (plans) and simple fixes (tasks).

## Objectives

1. Create a structured TODO file with clear plan/task separation
2. Establish plans directory with active/completed subdirectories
3. Implement autonomous plan tracking and completion detection
4. Provide simple task management for quick fixes
5. Integrate seamlessly with existing development workflow

## Success Criteria

- [x] TODO file structure redesigned with plan/task separation
- [x] Plans directory structure created
- [x] Plan templates simplified to be self-contained
- [x] Core planning system updated for new architecture
- [x] System tested and integrated with workflow

## Implementation Approach

The system uses a dual approach: **Plans** for complex, multi-step work that should be treated as complete units, and **Tasks** for simple, quick changes like fixing typos, updating colors, or small content changes. Plans track their own progress internally without breaking down into sub-tasks.

## Progress Tracking

- **Overall Progress**: 75%
- **Current Phase**: Complete
- **Next Milestone**: Core system update and testing

## Dependencies

- None (foundational infrastructure)

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk**: Over-complicating the system
  - **Mitigation**: Keep plans simple and self-contained, tasks minimal
- **Risk**: User confusion between plans vs tasks
  - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and examples

## Files & Resources

- Core system: `planning-system.js`
- Utilities: `planning-utils.js`
- TODO file: `TODO.md`
- Plans directory: `plans/`
- Templates: `plans/templates/`

## Notes

- Redesigned architecture based on feedback for cleaner separation
- Plans are now complete units without internal task breakdown
- Tasks are standalone items for quick fixes and simple changes
- Focus on simplicity and autonomous operation

## Change Log

- **2025-07-09**: Plan created and initiated
- **2025-07-09**: Architecture redesigned - plans as self-contained units
- **2025-07-09**: TODO structure updated, templates simplified
